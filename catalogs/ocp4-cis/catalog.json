In a multi-tenant cluster users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by knowing the image’s name, without any authorization check against the image ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are required.\n\nHowever, turning on this admission plugin can introduce new kinds of cluster failure modes. OpenShift 4 master and infrastructure components are deployed as pods. Enabling this feature can result in cases where loss of contact to an image registry can cause a redeployed infrastructure pod (`oauth-server` for example) to fail on an image pull for an image that is currently present on the node. We use `PullIfNotPresent` so that a loss of image registry access does not prevent the pod from starting. If it becomes `PullAlways`, then an image registry access outage can cause key infrastructure components to fail.\n\nThis can be managed per container. When OpenShift Container Platform creates containers, it uses the container’s `imagePullPolicy` to determine if the image should be pulled prior to starting the container. There are three possible values for `imagePullPolicy`: `Always`, `IfNotPresent`, `Never`. If a container’s `imagePullPolicy` parameter is not specified, OpenShift Container Platform sets it based on the image’s tag. If the tag is latest, OpenShift Container Platform defaults `imagePullPolicy` to `Always`. Otherwise, OpenShift Container Platform defaults `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent`."

Best practice is to ship audit logs off the cluster for retention. \n\nOpenShift includes the optional Cluster Logging operator and the `ElasticSearch` operator. OpenShift cluster logging can be configured to send logs to destinations outside of your OpenShift Container Platform cluster instead of the default `Elasticsearc`h log store using the following methods:\n\n- Sending logs using the `Fluentd` forward protocol. You can create a `Configmap` to use the `Fluentd` forward protocol to securely send logs to an external logging aggregator that accepts the Fluent forward protocol.\n- Sending logs using syslog. You can create a `Configmap` to use the syslog protocol to send logs to an external syslog (RFC 3164) server.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Log Forwarding API, currently in Technology Preview. The Log Forwarding API, which is easier to configure than the `Fluentd` protocol and syslog, exposes configuration for sending logs to the internal `lasticsearch` log store and to external `Fluentd` log aggregation solutions.\n\nYou cannot use the ConfigMap methods and the Log Forwarding API in the same cluster.\n\nVerify that audit log forwarding is configured as appropriate."

There are four TLS security profile types:\n\n- Old\n- Intermediate\n- Modern\n- Custom\n\nOnly the Old, Intermediate and Custom profiles are supported at this time for the Ingress controller. Custom provides the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters. Follow the steps in the documentation to configure the cipher suite for Ingress, API server and Authentication. https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress\n\nRun the following commands to verify the cipher suite and minTLSversion for the ingress operator, authentication operator, `cliconfig`, OpenShift `APIserver` and Kube APIserver.\n\n```\n# needs verification\n\n# verify cipher suites\noc describe --namespace=openshift-ingress-operator ingresscontroller/default\n\noc get kubeapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json |jq .spec.observedConfig.servingInfo\n\noc get openshiftapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json |jq .spec.observedConfig.servingInfo\n\noc get cm -n openshift-authentication v4-0-config-system-cliconfig -o jsonpath='{.data.v4\\-0\\-config\\-system\\-cliconfig}' | jq .servingInfo\n\n#check value for tlsSecurityProfile; null is returned if default is used\noc get kubeapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json |jq .spec.tlsSecurityProfile\n```\n\nVerify that the cipher suites are appropriate. \n\nVerify that the `tlsSecurityProfile` is set to the value you chose. \n\nNote: The HAProxy Ingress controller image does not support TLS 1.3 and because the Modern profile requires TLS 1.3, it is not supported. The Ingress Operator converts the Modern profile to Intermediate. The Ingress Operator also converts the TLS 1.0 of an Old or Custom profile to 1.1, and TLS 1.3 of a Custom profile to 1.2."
