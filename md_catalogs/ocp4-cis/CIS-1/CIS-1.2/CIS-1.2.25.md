# CIS-1.2.25 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the maximumFileSizeMegabytes argument is set to 100 or as appropriate

## Control Statement

Rotate log files on reaching 100 MB or as appropriate.

## Control rationale_statement

Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would have approximately 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Set the `audit-log-maxsize` parameter to `100` or as an appropriate number.

```
maximumFileSizeMegabytes: 100
```

## Control audit_procedure

OpenShift audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server. Configure via `maximumFileSizeMegabytes`. 

Run the following command:

```
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | \
 jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
 jq -r .auditConfig.maximumFileSizeMegabytes

oc get configmap config -n openshift-apiserver -ojson | \
 jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
 jq -r .auditConfig.maximumFileSizeMegabytes

for OCP 4.6 in place of jq -r .auditConfig.maximumFileSizeMegabytes use:
 jq -r '.apiServerArguments["audit-log-maxsize"][]?'
```

Verify that the `maximumFileSizeMegabytes` argument is set to `100` or as appropriate.
