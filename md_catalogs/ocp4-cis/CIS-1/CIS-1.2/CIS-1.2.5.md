# CIS-1.2.5 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the kubelet uses certificates to authenticate

## Control Statement

Enable certificate based kubelet authentication.

## Control rationale_statement

The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate-based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.

## Control impact_statement

Require TLS to be configured on the apiserver as well as kubelets.

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation is required. OpenShift platform components use X.509 certificates for authentication. OpenShift manages the CAs and certificates for platform components. This is not configurable.

## Control audit_procedure

OpenShift does not use the `--kubelet-client-certificate` or the `kubelet-client-ke`y arguments. OpenShift utilizes X.509 certificates for authentication of the control-plane components. OpenShift configures the API server to use an internal certificate authority (CA) to validate the user certificate sent during TLS negotiation. If the CA validation of the certificate is successful, the request is authenticated and user information is derived from the certificate subject fields. 

To verify the certificates are present, run the following command:

```
#for 4.5
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq '.kubeletClientInfo' 

#for 4.6
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq '.apiServerArguments'

#for both 4.5 and 4.6
oc -n openshift-apiserver describe secret serving-cert
```

Verify that the kubelet client-certificate and kubelet client-key files are present.

client-certificate: 

`/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/kubelet-client/tls.crt`

client-key: 

`/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/kubelet-client/tls.key`

Verify that the serving-cert for the `openshift-apiserver` is type `kubernetes.io/tls` and that returned Data includes `tls.crt` and `tls.key`.

TITLE:Leverage Vetted Modules or Services for Application Security Components CONTROL:v8 16.11 DESCRIPTION:Leverage vetted modules or services for application security components, such as identity management, encryption, and auditing and logging. Using platform features in critical security functions will reduce developersâ€™ workload and minimize the likelihood of design or implementation errors. Modern operating systems provide effective mechanisms for identification, authentication, and authorization and make those mechanisms available to applications. Use only standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed encryption algorithms. Operating systems also provide mechanisms to create and maintain secure audit logs.;TITLE:Utilize Client Certificates to Authenticate Hardware Assets CONTROL:v7 1.8 DESCRIPTION:Use client certificates to authenticate hardware assets connecting to the organization's trusted network.;
