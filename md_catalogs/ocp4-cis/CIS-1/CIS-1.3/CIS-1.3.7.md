# CIS-1.3.7 - \[Controller Manager\] Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Control Statement

Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

## Control rationale_statement

The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10257/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

None required. The OpenShift operators configure this correctly.

## Control audit_procedure

The `bind-address` argument is not used. The `secure-port` argument is set to `10257`. The `insecure-port` argument is set to `0`. 

Run the following command:

```
oc get configmaps config -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq '.extendedArguments["secure-port"][]'

oc get configmaps config -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq '.extendedArguments["port"][]'

#Following should fail with a http code 403
POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -l app=kube-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

oc rsh -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -c kube-controller-manager $POD curl https://localhost:10257/metrics -k
```

Verify that `secure-port` is set to `10257` and that `port` is set to `0`.

Verify that attempt to access the controller manager metrics fails with a HTTP code 403.
