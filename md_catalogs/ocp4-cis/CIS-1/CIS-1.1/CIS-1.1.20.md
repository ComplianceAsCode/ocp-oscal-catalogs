# CIS-1.1.20 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the OpenShift PKI certificate file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that OpenShift PKI certificate files have permissions of `644` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

OpenShift makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 644 or more restrictive to protect their integrity.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

Certificates for control plane components like `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kube-scheduler` are stored in the directory `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-certs/secrets`. Certificate files all have permissions `600`.

Run the following command.

```
# Should 600 or more restrictive

for i in $(oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get pod -l app=openshift-kube-apiserver -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 echo $i static-pod-certs
 oc exec -n openshift-kube-apiserver $i -c kube-apiserver -- \
 find /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-certs -type f -wholename '*/secrets/*.crt' -exec stat -c %a {} \;
done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600`.
