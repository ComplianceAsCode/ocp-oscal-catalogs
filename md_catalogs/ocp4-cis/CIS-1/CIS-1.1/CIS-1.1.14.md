## Control Statement

Ensure that the `admin.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The `admin.conf` file contains the admin credentials for the cluster. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None.

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4 the admin config file is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` with ownership `root:root`.

Run the following command.

```
for i in $(oc get nodes -o name)
 do
 echo $i
 oc debug $i -- <<EOF
 chroot /host
 stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig
EOF

```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
