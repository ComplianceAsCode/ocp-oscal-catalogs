# CIS-1.1.13 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `admin.conf` file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The `admin.conf` is the administrator `kubeconfig` file defining various settings for the administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Control impact_statement

None.

## Control remediation_procedure

Execute the command below:

```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig/admin.config
```

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4 the admin config file is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` with permissions `644`.

Run the following command.

```
for i in $(oc get nodes -o name)
 do
 echo $i
 oc debug $i -- <<EOF
 chroot /host
 stat -c%a /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig/admin.config
EOF
 done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
