# CIS-1.1.10 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the Container Network Interface file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the Container Network Interface files have ownership set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) deploys and manages the cluster network components on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This includes the Container Network Interface (CNI) default network provider plug-in selected for the cluster during installation. OpenShift Container Platform uses the Multus CNI plug-in to allow chaining of CNI plug-ins. The default Pod network must be configured during cluster installation. By default, the CNO deploys the OpenShift SDN as the default Pod network. 

Ensure that the `multu` and `openshift-sdn` file ownership is set to root:root and the Open vSwitch (OVS) file ownership is set to `openvswitch:openvswitch`. 

The SDN components are deployed as DaemonSets across the master/worker nodes with controllers limited to control plane nodes. OpenShift deploys OVS as a network overlay by default. Various configurations (ConfigMaps and other files managed by the operator via `hostpath` but stored on the container hosts) are stored in the following locations:

CNI:

`/etc/cni/net.d`
`/host/var/run/multus/cni/net.d`

SDN:

`/var/lib/cni/networks/openshift-sdn `
`/var/run/openshift-sdn`

SDN OVS:

`/var/run/openvswitch`
`/etc/openvswitch`
`/run/openvswitch`

Run the following commands.

```

# For CNI multus
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-multus -l app=multus -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-multus $i -- /bin/bash -c "stat -c \"%U:%G %n\" /host/etc/cni/net.d/*.conf"; done

for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-multus -l app=multus -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-multus $i -- /bin/bash -c "stat -c \"%U:%G %n\" /host/var/run/multus/cni/net.d/*.conf"; done

# For SDN pods
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- find /var/lib/cni/networks/openshift-sdn -type f -exec stat -c \"%U:%G\" {} \;; done

for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- find /var/run/openshift-sdn -type f -exec stat -c %U:%G {} \;; done

# For OVS pods in 4.5
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=ovs -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- find /var/run/openvswitch -type f -exec stat -c %U:%G {} \;; done 

for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=ovs -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- find /etc/openvswitch -type f -exec stat -c %U:%G {} \;; done 

for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=ovs -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- find /run/openvswitch -type f -exec stat -c %U:%G {} \;; done 

# For OVS pods in 4.6
TBD
```

Verify that the CNI and SDN file ownership is set to `root:root`.

`/host/etc/cni/net.d/00-multus.conf = root:root`
`/host/var/run/multus/cni/net.d/80-openshift-network.conf = root:root`
`/var/lib/cni/networks/openshift-sdn = root:root`
`/var/run/openshift-sdn = root:root`

Verify that the OVS file ownership is set to `openvswitch:openvswitch`.

`/var/run/openvswitch = openvswitch:openvswitch`
`/etc/openvswitch = openvswitch:openvswitch`
`/run/openvswitch = openvswitch:openvswitch`
