# CIS-1.1.21 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the OpenShift PKI key file permissions are set to 600

## Control Statement

Ensure that the OpenShift PKI key files have permissions of `600`.

## Control rationale_statement

OpenShift makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to `600` to protect their integrity and confidentiality.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

Keys for control plane components like `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, `ube-scheduler` and `etcd` are stored with their respective static pod configurations in the directory `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-certs/secrets`. Key files all have permissions `600`.

Run the following command.

```
for i in $(oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get pod -l app=openshift-kube-apiserver -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 echo $i static-pod-certs
 oc exec -n openshift-kube-apiserver $i -c kube-apiserver -- \
 find /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-certs -type f -wholename '*/secrets/*.key' -exec stat -c %a {} \;
done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600`.
