# CIS-1.1.15 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the scheduler.conf file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `scheduler.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The `scheduler.conf` file is the `kubeconfig` file for the Scheduler. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

execute command:

chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/scheduler-kubeconfig/kubeconfig/scheduler.conf

## Control audit_procedure

The `kubeconfig` file for `kube-scheduler` is stored in the ConfigMap `scheduler-kubeconfig` in the namespace `openshift-kube-scheduler`. The file `kubeconfig` (`scheduler.conf`) is referenced in the pod via `hostpath` and is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/scheduler-kubeconfig/kubeconfig/scheduler.conf' with permissions `644`.

Run the following command :

```
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-kube-scheduler -l app=openshift-kube-scheduler -o name)
 do
 oc exec -n openshift-kube-scheduler $i -- \
 stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/scheduler-kubeconfig/kubeconfig/scheduler.conf
 done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
