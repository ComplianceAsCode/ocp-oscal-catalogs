# CIS-1.1.17 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the controller-manager.conf file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The `controller-manager.conf` file is the `kubeconfig` file for the Controller Manager. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

execute command:

```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/controller-manager-kubeconfig/kubeconfig/controller-manager.conf
```

## Control audit_procedure

The `kubeconfig` file for `kube-controller-manager` is stored in the ConfigMap `controller-manager-kubeconfig` in the namespace `openshift-kube-controller-manager`. The file `kubeconfig` (`controller-manager.conf`) is referenced in the pod via `hostpath` and is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/controller-manager-kubeconfig/kubeconfig` with permissions `644`.

Run the following command.

```
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -l app=kube-controller-manager -oname)
 do
 oc exec -n openshift-kube-controller-manager $i -- \
 stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/controller-manager-kubeconfig/kubeconfig/controller-manager.conf
 done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
