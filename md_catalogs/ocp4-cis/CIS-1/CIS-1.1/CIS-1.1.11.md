# CIS-1.1.11 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that the etcd data directory has permissions of `700` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

`etcd` is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required. File permissions are managed by the `etcd` operator.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, `etcd` members are deployed on the master nodes as static pods. The pod specification file is created on control plane nodes at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-member.yaml`. The `etcd` database is stored on the container host in `/var/lib/etcd` and mounted to the `etcd-member` container via the host path mount data-dir with the same filesystem path (`/var/lib/etcd`). The permissions for this directory on the container host is `700`. 

Starting with OCP 4.4, `etcd` is managed by the `cluster-etcd-operator`. The `etcd` operator will help to automate restoration of master nodes. There is also a new `etcdctl` container in the `etcd` static pod for quick debugging. cluster-admin rights are required to exec into `etcd` containers.

Run the following commands.

```
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-etcd -l app=etcd -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-etcd -c etcd $i -- stat -c %a%n /var/lib/etcd/member; done
```

Verify that the permissions are `700`.

TITLE:Configure Data Access Control Lists CONTROL:v8 3.3 DESCRIPTION:Configure data access control lists based on a userâ€™s need to know. Apply data access control lists, also known as access permissions, to local and remote file systems, databases, and applications.;TITLE:Protect Information through Access Control Lists CONTROL:v7 14.6 DESCRIPTION:Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.;
