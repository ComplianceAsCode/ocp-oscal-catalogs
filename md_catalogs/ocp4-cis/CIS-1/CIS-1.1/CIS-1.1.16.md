# CIS-1.1.16 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the scheduler.conf file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `scheduler.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The `scheduler.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

The `kubeconfig` file for `kube-scheduler` is stored in the ConfigMap `scheduler-kubeconfig` in the namespace `openshift-kube-scheduler`. The file `kubeconfig` (scheduler.conf) is referenced in the pod via `hostpath` and is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/scheduler-kubeconfig/kubeconfig` with ownership `root:root`.

Run the following command.

```
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-kube-scheduler -l app=openshift-kube-scheduler -o name)
 do
 oc exec -n openshift-kube-scheduler $i -- \
 stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/scheduler-kubeconfig/kubeconfig
 done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
