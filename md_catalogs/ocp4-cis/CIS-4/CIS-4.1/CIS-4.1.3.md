# CIS-4.1.3 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] If proxy kubeconfig file exists ensure permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

If `kube-proxy` is running, and if it is using a file-based kubeconfig file, ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The `kube-proxy` kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

It is possible to run `kube-proxy` with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

execute command:

chmod 600 /config/kube-proxy-config.yaml

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, the `kube-proxy` runs within the `sdn` pods, which copies the `kubeconfig` from a configmap to the container at `/tmp/kubeconfig`, with `644` permissions.

Run the following command:

```

for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn -oname)
do
 oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- \
 stat -Lc %a /config/kube-proxy-config.yaml
done
```

Verify that the `kube-proxy-config.yaml` file has permissions of `600`.
