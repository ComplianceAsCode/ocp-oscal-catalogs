# CIS-4.1.1 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that the kubelet service file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

execute command:

```
chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
```

## Control audit_procedure

Kubelet is run as a `systemd` unit and its configuration file is created with `644` permissions.

Run the following command:

```

for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
