# CIS-4.1.6 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

None required.

## Control audit_procedure

The node's `kubeconfig` is created with `root:root` ownership. 

Run the following command:

```

for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
