# CIS-4.1.10 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the kubelet configuration file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file is owned by `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

None required.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, the kublet config file is managed by the Machine Config Operator. The kubelet config file is found at `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig` with ownership set to `root:root`.

Run the command:

```

for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/kubelet/config.json
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
