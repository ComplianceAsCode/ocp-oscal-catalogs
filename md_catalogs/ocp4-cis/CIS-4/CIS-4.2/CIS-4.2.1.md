# CIS-4.2.1 - \[Kubelet\] Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false

## Control Statement

Disable anonymous requests to the Kubelet server.

## Control rationale_statement

When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests.

## Control impact_statement

Anonymous requests will be rejected.

## Control remediation_procedure

Follow the instructions in the documentation to create a Kubelet config CRD and set the `anonymous-auth` is set to `false`.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, the kublet config file is managed by the Machine Config Operator and `anonymous-auth` is set to `false` by default.

Run the following command on each node:

```

for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
do
 oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host grep -B4 -A1 anonymous: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.conf
done
```

Verify that the `anonymous-auth` argument is set to `false`.
